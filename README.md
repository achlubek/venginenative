### VEngine is a library to base your graphical application on, like, a game or a 3d spectrum visualizer, or many other.

##### What we got here
- Graphics system using Vulkan with help of GLFW3 (also provides input) https://github.com/glfw/glfw
- Image loading using stb_image https://github.com/nothings/stb

##### Urgent things to do
- Linux makefiles and hopefully cmake
- Images mipmapping with handy api
- Images rebuffering
- Support for custom vertex attribs layouts
- Semaphores abstraction to handle synchronization automatically with "depending on" style rules
- Thorought logging support with various levels of logging
- Maybe some debugger
